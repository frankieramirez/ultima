<!-- BEGIN MANA PERSONA -->
## Persona at invocation

Before conversational narration, read `Persona:` and `Style:` in the active project's `## Agent skills` block from `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. Prefer the file containing the block, then an existing file; ties use `CLAUDE.md`. A symlink pair is one file. Read the saved value anew on each invocation, including from a subdirectory using the project root. No accessible project or no line means ordinary behavior. Do not search another project or global settings for this preference.

During the `Persona at invocation` stage, `archmage` on either line loads this skill's own [references/archmage.md](references/archmage.md) for the active workflow. `off` or an absent value leaves ordinary behavior active. An unknown value leaves ordinary behavior active and gets a brief explanation when conversational output is allowed; it does not stop the work. Explicit conversation instructions override the saved voice without writing settings. A request to enable Archmage for this workflow also loads the local reference.

Apply the voice only to lead-agent conversation. Deliverables, specialist roles, reply-only responses, and JSON-only output retain their contracts, with no added narration. End the persona with this workflow unless the user requests otherwise or a `Style:` line names `archmage`, which keeps the voice on for the whole session.

# Cast

Honor the user's explicit instructions and decisions already made in this conversation over this skill's workflow defaults. A rule this file states with never, or as read-only, is a gate: it holds whatever the conversation says, and an instruction to cross one is declined and reported. Continue authorized work; ask only about unresolved choices that would materially change the result. Preparing or reviewing work does not authorize publishing it.

If a skill rule requires a pause or leaves requested work unfinished, name and link to the exact SKILL.md and quote the rule. Then explain what decision or prerequisite is missing. Distinguish a required gate from your interpretation.

Build the work described by one ticket, spec, or the current conversation. Stay on the current branch. Commit when the work matches the ticket. Push and open a pull request with visual evidence. Pass `no-pr` to stop after the commit (and push only if an upstream already exists).

## Operating principles

- **One ticket.** The invocation names the work. Do not wander onto adjacent issues.
- **Smallest shape that passes.** Build the least structure that satisfies the ticket, and write one plain line when one line does the job. A helper, option, or abstraction needs a consumer that exists now. This is YAGNI: you aren't gonna need it.
- **Never switch to an existing branch.** `git checkout <branch>`, `git switch <branch>`, and `gh pr checkout` are out. If the ticket belongs on another branch, stop and say so. The one branch this skill creates is a fresh one off the default branch, when the session starts there, before any edit (Stage 1).
- **Claim before work.** A ticket from the tracker gets assigned to the person driving this session first, so a parallel session skips it. Held by someone else: stop.
- **The ticket is the contract.** A comment labelled as an agent brief, or a spec file, wins over the original issue body when they disagree.
- **Leave the review to a later pass.** This skill commits the implementation. It does not run a multi-reviewer critique.
- **Ship by default.** After the commit, push (creating the upstream if needed) and open a pull request with visual evidence. `no-pr` restores commit-only, with a push only when an upstream already exists.
- **Orca is optional.** Inside an Orca worktree (`ORCA_WORKTREE_ID` is set and `command -v orca` succeeds), the skill also keeps the worktree card current: the linked ticket, the status column, and a one-line comment. Without Orca nothing changes. An `orca` call that fails is noted in the report and never stops the run. When the skill stops early, leave the reason as the comment: `orca worktree set --worktree active --comment "<reason>" --json`.

## Arguments

Parse tokens, then treat the remainder as the target.

| Token | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `no-pr` | Stop after Stage 4. Push only when an upstream already exists. |

| Input | Target |
|-------|--------|
| none | The ticket or spec already in this conversation. If none is obvious, stop and ask for a number. |
| number or issue URL | That GitHub issue |
| `next` | The oldest open `ready-for-agent` issue that nobody holds and nothing blocks |
| a path | That file, treated as the spec |

## Execution spine

1. Load the ticket (Stage 1).
2. Build it (Stage 2).
3. Clean up comments in this session's changes (Stage 2a), then check the diff against the ticket (Stage 3).
4. Commit, and push only when the branch already has an upstream (Stage 4).
5. Capture proof and open the pull request (Stage 5). Skip when `no-pr`.
6. Report the ticket result, then check its build parent and give the next action (Stage 6).

`<SKILL_DIR>` is the absolute directory this SKILL.md lives in. Substitute the real path every time it appears. Do not assign it to a shell variable first: a sandboxed or worktree-isolated session refuses `bash "$VAR/script.sh"` because it cannot resolve the path to read the script.

---

## Tracker

Read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` when it exists. Its `Tracker:` line names the tracker and its `Adapter flags:` line gives the flags for the bundled script. Missing file: GitHub, no flags. On a GitHub Enterprise host, pass `GH_HOST=<host>` inline too. Ticket ids are whatever the tracker uses (`42`, `ENG-42`, `PLAT-42`).

The operations below are `next`, `claim`, and `view`; build progress also uses `children`, `body`, `update-body`, `comment`, and `close`. On Linear or Jira, when the host exposes a connector for that tracker, use it for them; it is already authenticated. Inside an Orca worktree, `orca linear` is such a connector for Linear: `orca linear issue <id> --comments --relations --json` is `view`, `orca linear assignee set` is `claim`, and `orca linear --help` lists the rest. `next` through a connector means: the oldest open issue carrying the ready label, with no assignee and no open blocking relation, excluding bodies marked `Work kind: build`. `claim` means: read the assignee, stop if it is someone else, assign yourself, read it again. After a connector `next` plus `claim`, view the ticket. If it is a build parent, closed, missing the ready label, or still blocked, unassign yourself and stop before creating `cast/<id>-*`. Otherwise run the script with the adapter flags. GitHub always goes through the script. Never mix the two in one run. For `local`, the ticket is a file: `next` is the lowest-numbered ticket file with `Status: ready-for-agent`, no `Work kind: build` marker, and no open `Blocked by:`, and claim is rewriting that line to `Status: claimed`. Re-read the file after claiming; if a `Blocked by:` file is still open, set `Status: ready-for-agent` and stop. For `other`, follow the tracker file's Conventions by hand.

## Stage 1: Load

**`next`.** Resolve the ready label: the string `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` maps for `ready-for-agent` when that file exists, else `ready-for-agent`. Then:

```bash
bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/tickets.sh" <adapter flags> next <ready string> --claim
```

Empty output means nothing is ready. Say so in one line and stop; a loop that calls this on a schedule should stay quiet. `--claim` assigns the ticket only while it is still open, still carries the ready label, and is still unblocked; otherwise the script releases it and tries the next candidate. The first field is the ticket id. Do not call `claim` again on this path.

**Id, URL, or local path.** Read the issue or file first to identify its role. If its body contains the exact line `Work kind: build`, load `references/build-progress.md`, report progress, and stop without claiming it or creating a branch. Otherwise claim the ticket before implementation. An explicit ticket id does not have to carry the ready label:

```bash
bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/tickets.sh" <adapter flags> claim ID
```

`ID` is a tracker id (`42`, `ENG-42`, `PLAT-42`) or a GitHub, Linear, or Jira issue URL; the script extracts the id. Exit 1 with "already claimed by" names the other holder: stop and say who has it. A ticket already assigned to you is fine. Exit 3 means the token cannot write; note it in the report and continue unclaimed.

Fetch the ticket with its comments:

```bash
bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/tickets.sh" <adapter flags> view ID
```

Retain the ticket's `Build parent:` link for Stage 6 even when a linked spec or newer brief takes precedence. A `Builds toward:` link alone is legacy planning provenance. `Planning source:` and parent links supply context; they do not replace the ticket's brief with the whole effort's spec.

Prefer, in this order: the latest comment headed `## Agent Brief`; a linked spec path named in the body; the ticket body itself.

**Orca card.** Inside an Orca worktree (`ORCA_WORKTREE_ID` is set and `command -v orca` succeeds), link the ticket to the worktree card once it is claimed. GitHub: `orca worktree set --worktree active --issue <n> --json`. Linear: `--linear-issue <ENG-42>` instead. Jira, local, or other: `--comment "<id> <title>"` instead, since the card has no field for those. Skip this for a spec path or the conversation.

**Branch.** Compare the current branch with the repo default:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name
```

When they match, create the working branch now, before any edit, and never commit to the default branch:

```bash
git switch -c cast/<id>-<short-kebab-slug-from-the-title>
```

The id is lowercased as it appears on the tracker (`cast/42-flat-tax`, `cast/eng-42-flat-tax`). For a spec path or the conversation with no ticket, name it `cast/<slug>`. Any other current branch is the working branch as it stands.

**A path.** Read that file. It is the spec and the contract.

**Blank.** Use the ticket or spec already in this conversation. If none is obvious, stop and ask.

Read `CONTEXT.md` when it exists, and any ADR that sits in the same area as the change. Use the project's words for types and names.

Write a 2 to 4 line intent you will implement:

```
Intent: <what will be true when this ticket is done>
Seams: <public interfaces you will test at, or "none: no test harness">
```

Do not start coding until that intent is written. If the ticket is still a question (a decision, not a build), stop. This skill builds ready work.

## Stage 2: Build

When the change has meaningful behavior to verify and the repo has a test harness, read `references/tdd.md` and follow it at the seams you wrote down. Docs, configuration, and other changes with no behavioral effect do not require a TDD loop just because a harness exists. If there is no harness, build without a red-green loop and say so once.

Typecheck and run meaningful behavior tests around the files you touch as you go. Run the project's required validation: use the `Validation:` line in the `## Agent skills` block of `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` when one exists, else what the repo's manifest and docs name. A successful validation may be reused when no edits have happened since it ran. Classify a failure against the pre-change baseline first. Rerun it after a new edit or an unresolved concern that needs a fresh run.

Stay inside the ticket's scope. Adjacent cleanup waits.

Inside that scope, build the smallest shape that satisfies the ticket. When one plain line does the job, write one line. A helper earns its place when the same line appears a second time, and an interface, option, or registry when a second consumer exists in this diff or the codebase. Later is no reason on its own. The signal has to be present now.

## Stage 2a: Comment cleanup

Inspect this session's diff for added or modified code comments, including suppressions. If there are none, report the pass as skipped and continue. Documentation prose and generated files are outside this pass.

Read `references/comment-cleanup.md` and follow it before the spec check. Its reviewer instructions are bundled in `references/comment-reaper.md`; no separate skill installation is required. Limit deletions to comments added or modified by this session and repairs to code changed for this ticket. Surrounding code is read-only context. Never use the whole branch diff as a substitute for this session's scope.

## Stage 3: Spec check

Read `references/spec-check.md` and walk it against the diff and the ticket. If a criterion fails, fix it before committing. If a criterion cannot be met on this branch, stop and report it. Do not commit a partial that pretends to be the ticket.

## Stage 4: Commit

At the start of the session, record `git status --porcelain` and the unstaged and staged diffs (`git diff`, `git diff --cached`). Stop when a file this session will edit already has unstaged or staged hunks.

Stage only this session's changes. `git add <file>` stages every hunk in that file, dirty ones included, and `git commit` includes whatever was already in the index. Before you commit, confirm `git diff --cached` holds only this session.

```bash
git add <files you changed>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<subject from the ticket title>

<one or two lines on what landed, with the issue number>
EOF
)"
```

Follow the repo's commit conventions when it has them.

Push only when an upstream is already configured:

```bash
if git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git push
fi
```

If the push is rejected because the remote moved, `git pull --rebase` only when the tree is otherwise clean and the rebase is conflict-free. Otherwise stop. Never force-push.

## Stage 5: Ship

Skip this stage when `no-pr` was passed. Stage 4 has already committed, and pushed only when an upstream existed. Stage 5 never runs if Stage 4 did not commit.

Read `references/capture.md`, `references/body.md`, and `references/attach.md`. Before capturing proof, check the current branch against the fetched PR base:

```bash
bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/open-pr.sh" --check
```

On exit 4, merge the reported `base_sha` into the current branch with a clean working tree. Read the commits and both versions of each conflicting file. Resolve changes whose intended behavior is clear, keeping both intents where compatible. Run the project's validation, including tests covering the merged behavior, then commit the resolution. Never force-push. When choosing between the changes requires a product decision, stop editing and report the exact decision and affected files. Preserve the work as a draft PR if none exists: put the blocker in its body, return to a clean committed tree without discarding work, and use `--draft`. If unresolved paths prevent that, report the local operation and blocker instead of attempting to ship.

After a resolution, rerun the preflight and capture fresh proof. A failed fetch or check is a blocker, never evidence of a clean merge. Push so the branch exists on the remote:

```bash
if git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git push
else
  git push -u origin HEAD
fi
```

Same rebase-or-stop rule as Stage 4. Never force-push.

Capture at least one proof file. The body ends with a closing line for the ticket (`Closes #42`, `Closes ENG-42`; see the closing line in `references/body.md`). Then run `scripts/open-pr.sh` with the title, body file, and attaches.

The script repeats the preflight and checks GitHub after writing. If exit 4 reports conflicts after writing, rerun the preflight command to fetch the current base before using the same resolution procedure. Validate and refresh proof, then push and update the PR. Limit this to two resolution passes per run; continued base movement gets a concrete handoff. Exit 5 means mergeability remains unknown: report the URL and uncertainty without claiming the PR is ready. Existing PRs keep their review state. Clean mergeability applies to the checked snapshot; it does not guarantee future base changes or semantic compatibility.

**Orca card.** Inside an Orca worktree (`ORCA_WORKTREE_ID` is set and `command -v orca` succeeds), move the card once the PR exists and mergeability is clean:

```bash
orca worktree set --worktree active --workspace-status in-review --comment "PR <url>" --json
```

On Linear, also attach the PR to the issue so it shows there before the merge: `orca linear attach <ENG-42> --url <pr url> --title "Pull request" --json`.

## Stage 6: Build progress

After preparing the ticket result below, load `references/build-progress.md` when the ticket has a `Build parent:` link. Check the parent and append the next action to the same final response. Run this after `no-pr` too. A publishing failure still gets a progress report when the tracker is readable. An open PR remains pending review; do not close its ticket or the parent merely because this session finished implementation. Stop after the handoff rather than beginning another ticket.

For a local ticket or a direct local build-parent path, use its file membership and the same reference. A direct parent path only checks progress. A ticket without a build parent retains its current workflow.

## Scripts

`scripts/tickets.sh` finds the next unclaimed ready ticket, claims it, and reads it, on GitHub (`git` and `gh` only), Linear, or Jira (`python3` and the tracker's environment variables). Exit 3 means the token cannot write. `tickets.sh -h` prints usage. `scripts/open-pr.sh` opens or edits the pull request with `--attach`.
