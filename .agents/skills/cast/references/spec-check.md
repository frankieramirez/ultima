# Spec check

Walk the ticket against the diff before you commit. The ticket wins.

## Collect the criteria

From the agent brief, spec, or issue body, list every acceptance criterion and every explicit out-of-scope line. If the ticket has no checklist, write four or fewer observable outcomes from the desired behavior (what a user or caller can see).

## For each criterion

- **Met.** Quote the file or test that shows it.
- **Unmet.** Fix it now, or stop. An unmet criterion is a failed cast.
- **Out of scope on the ticket.** Leave it. Mention it under Open in the report so it does not look forgotten.

## First-principles pass

Read the diff once more for work the ticket did not ask for. Revert drive-by edits that are unrelated. Keep a change that the ticket's desired behavior required even if the checklist omitted it, and name it in the report.

Restate the intended outcome and interrogate the implementation from first principles. Given what you now know, does the approach still make sense? Which assumptions are weak? What is unnecessary? What can be deleted entirely? After those deletions, what can be simplified?

Make changes where there is a concrete benefit within the agreed scope. Prefer deleting over simplifying, simplifying over optimizing, and optimizing over automating. Preserve required behavior and follow the validation step below after edits.

A clean pass is a valid outcome. If the implementation already serves the goal clearly, leave it alone.

## Validation

Run the project's required validation after the last edit: use the `Validation:` line in the `## Agent skills` block of `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` when one exists, else the commands you already used in Stage 2. If it already passed and no edits happened since, reuse that success. Classify a failure against the pre-change baseline first. Rerun after a new edit or an unresolved concern that needs a fresh run. The baseline is the same command before this session's edits, or a failure recorded at the start. A new failure: fix it or do not commit. A failure proven to have existed before this session: proceed, and add a commit footer `Note: <test> was already failing before these changes.`
